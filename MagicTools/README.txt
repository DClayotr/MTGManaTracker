A command-line style app. that I wrote to help me keep track of floating mana in a TCG I play with my friends. 

The user can:
-Add any amount of mana, in any legal color to the pool.
-Spend mana that they have floating
-Add to their storm count 
-Empty the mana pool (they would do this to either spend all their mana)
  -the empty command also functions as a call back when the users inputs that their turn has ended
